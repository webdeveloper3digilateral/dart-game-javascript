This project started it's life as a Proof-of-concept demonstrator <br/>
which should test the casual gaming capabilities of an O2 TV settop box <br/>
which was a linux box with a modified firefox browser, all before the HTML5-era <br/>
so without the canvas and related stuff. It's a vanilla JS directly injected into <br/>
the index.html file. Everything is a div styled with css and moved around with JS.<br/>
